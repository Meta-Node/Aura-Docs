# ⬆️ Level Up

The "Level Up" tab of your home screen will tell you what to do to reach the next Aura Player level.&#x20;

As [Aura Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) submit positive evaluations of you, your Aura Player score and level will increase. The higher your Player level, the greater your ability will be to help people get verified.&#x20;

You unlock the ability to be evaluated by Trainers once you've made your third evaluation.

The Level Up tab will show which of your BrightID connections are Trainers. It will also show which of your connections are Players, so that you can find Trainers through them.

You should contact Trainers and ask them to review your evaluations.&#x20;

## Viewing your Evaluations

Once you've received an evaluation from a Trainer, you'll see it in the "Level Up" tab If an evaluation is low, you can ask the Trainer that gave it to you what you can do to improve it.
