# ðŸ‘¸ Verification levels

## Helping people get verified

When you give a person an [honesty rating](honesty.md), they may achieve an Aura verification level of "bronze," "sliver," or "gold."\
\
The verification level will be shown on the top right of their profile page.  If they aren't yet verified, the words "not yet" will be shown.\

Before you can verify people, you will need [energy](energy.md).\
