From the subject profile screen, you can check your connection level to a person, whether or not they set up social recovery, and the last time they used their BrightID. These help you decide whether the person still has control over their account or if it's a duplicate.

When you're ready to evaluate, choose a confidence level from "Low" to "Very High."  Be careful not to overstate your confidence--[Aura Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) will review your evaluations for accuracy.

Once you submit three evaluations, you unlock the ability to level up by having [Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) review your work.
