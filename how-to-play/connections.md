Choose a confidence level from "Low" to "Very High."  Be careful not to overstate your confidence--[Aura Trainers](../advanced-roles/trainers.md) will review your evaluations for accuracy.

Every subject profile has an ["Evidence"](broken-reference) section which you should use to help you make your evaluation.

Once you've submitted three evaluations, you've unlocked the ability to level up by having Trainers review your work.
