Choose a confidence level from "Low" to "Very High."  Be careful not to overstate your confidence--[Aura Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) will review your evaluations for accuracy.

Every subject profile has an ["Evidence"](broken-reference) section which you should use to help you make your evaluation.

Once you submit three evaluations, you unlock the ability to level up by having [Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) review your work.
