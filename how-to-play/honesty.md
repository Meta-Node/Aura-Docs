# 📜 Honesty

## Honesty

As an Aura player, your main task is to rate the honesty of your "already known" BrightID connections. This allows them to receive a [verification level.](verification-levels.md)

### Setting honesty

From a person's profile page you can use the slider to set an "honesty" rating from -4 (definitely a [sybil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack)) to 4 (definitely not a sybil)\

### Mutual Connections

Players look at their mutual connections with the person they're researching. If expected “already known” connections are missing, this could be a sign of a sybil attack, and a player should reduce the person's honesty rating.
