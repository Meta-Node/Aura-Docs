## Evaluate

The first thing you'll do as a new Aura Player is evaluate the people you've connected to in the BrightID mobile app.

These are your friends and family that will receive an Aura verification because of your evaluations.

Submitting evaluations will increase your Aura player level--if Aura trainers agree that you're doing a good job. The higher your player level, the greater your ability to help people get verified.&#x20;

Your BrightID connections will show in the list of "Subjects." Click one to see their [subject profile](connections.md) and evaluate them.
