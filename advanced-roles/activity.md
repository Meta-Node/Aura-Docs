When you're on a person's profile view that has an Aura role, you'll see additional icons to the right of the subject icon.

If you select a role, you'll see a new tab in the "Evidence" section called "Activity." This will show the evaluations the person has made acting in that role. Players evaluate Subjects, Trainers evaluate Players, and Managers evaluate both Trainers and other Managers.

If you have an advanced role, you should look at a person's activity. This is your main source of evidence along with [evaluations](../evidence/evaluations.md) they've received from others.
