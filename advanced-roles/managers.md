# 🦸‍♀️ Managers

Manager is an advance role in Aura. Managers evaluate Trainers in the same way Trainers evaluate Players and Players evaluate Subjects.

A Manager uses evidence by looking at a Trainer's [activity](../evidence/activity.md), meaning the evaluations a Trainer has made, and also how other Managers have [evaluated](../evidence/evaluations.md) the Trainer.\
\
Managers can also evaluate other Managers in the same way they evaluate Trainers. Manager scores can be traced back to [team owners](../concepts/teams.md), who are the first Managers for a [team](../concepts/teams.md).
