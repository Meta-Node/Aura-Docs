# ðŸ‘¥ Teams & Leagues

## Teams

Having multiple teams provides resilience to Aura.  If one team becomes flawed, other teams can continue to operate with minimal disruption to [providing evaluations to apps](../intro/how-aura-works.md#expert-evaluations).

### Creation and management

[Sybil defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack) can create a team after paying a fee and selecting at least one captain.

Team captains can add or remove other team captains with a 2/3 majority vote.

### Scores & Levels

Each team generates scores for its participants independently from other teams. Scores come from participants evaluating each other.

Captains can define team levels for Subjects, Players, Trainers, and Managers based on scores and other requirements such as receiving evaluations of a certain confidence or from participants with a certain level.

Team scores and levels are used by leagues in aggregate scores and levels.

### Managers

Team captains become the first managers and can begin evaluating each other and other managers and trainers.&#x20;

### Team Membership

Managers and Trainers are responsible for deciding which Aura participants belong to which teams. A Manager or Trainer can choose to add a participant they evaluate to any of the teams they belong to themselves. They evaluate a participant only once per role, but the evaluation will contribute to a score for the participant in each of the teams they've chosen to include.

Most of the time participants will only see one score which is an aggregate of several team scores  whose formula is decided by a [league](teams.md#leagues).

## Leagues

A league creates a formula to aggregate team scores. As teams gain or lose utility, the league adjusts the formula. It creates aggregate levels that can easily be understood and used by apps. It also creates aggregate scores and levels for participants so they don't have to check multiple team scores and levels.

Leagues are responsible for [marketing Aura to apps and paying participants.](../intro/how-aura-works.md#rewards)\

Anyone can create a league by creating their own aggregate formulas and levels and marketing them to apps. Being able to quickly fork or spin up a new league adds to the [resilience](../intro/how-aura-works.md#resilience) of the overall Aura system.
