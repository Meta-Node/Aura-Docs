# 👨‍🏫 Trainers

Trainer is an advance role in Aura. Trainers evaluate Players in the same way Players evaluate Subjects.

A Trainer uses evidence by looking at a Player's [activity](../evidence/activity.md), meaning the evaluations a Player has made, and also how other Trainers have [evaluated](../evidence/evaluations.md) the Player.
