# 🌀 What is Aura?

Aura is a decentralized way to evaluate and determine eligibility.

Domains that can be evaluated:

* Human uniqueness (one account per person)
* Work performance or eligibility
* Certifications
* Community membership
* Physical residence
* Insurance claims
* Grant eligibility
* Accomplishments or impact
* Voter eligibility
* Compliance

Although Aura was original created to assist in the human uniqueness (BrightID) domain, the mechanism is interoperable with these and many other domains.

What sets Aura apart:

* Participation is open to anyone
* Evaluation impact is determined by existing participants and the wisdom of the crowd (those who rely on Aura evaluations)

### Participation & Privacy

Although anyone is welcome to play Aura to create evaluations or verify other people, this isn't required to get an Aura verification.

People who just want a verification should follow the simple instructions in Aura Verified. No personal information is shared with Aura players that they don't already know.

Proofs (verifications) follow advanced standards of privacy to ensure that no one links additional information or previous activity when they share a proof with an app.
