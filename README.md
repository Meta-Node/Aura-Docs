# 🌀 What is Aura?

Aura is an open, decentralized network that lets experts evaluate each other and in turn evaluate subjects, generating privacy-preserving proofs in domains such as unique humanity, community membership, residence, insurance claims, acts of kindness, platform moderation, regulatory compliance, grant reviews, open source impact, and credentialing. Aura evaluations produce digital attestations that infuse reality into online activities.

Aura decentralizes administration by inviting those closest to the source of truth to evaluate claims and make objective rulings. It uses existing trust relationships for oversight.\
\
In the BrightID domain, experts evaluate whether a BrightID identifier is a person's only identifier or a duplicate. This can result in a positive Aura verification level, which can unlock that person's ability to link to apps that want an assurance that they only have one account.

Integrating apps can let users log in normally using OAuth or Passkeys or [the BrightID mobile app](getting-started/get-brightid.md) can be used to create a universal, socially recoverable identifier.

Although anyone is welcome to play Aura to help verify other people, this isn't required to get an Aura verification. Instead, most people should follow the simple instructions in Aura Verified. No personal information is shared with Aura players that they don't already know.
