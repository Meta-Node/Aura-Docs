# Goals of Aura

### Privacy first

BrightID activity is a primary source of verification information in Aura. Aura inherits the same privacy rule as BrightID: no information should be shared with anyone that doesn't already know it.

Aura relies on verification by people that already know you. This is in contrast to privacy-invading verification methods which require providing personal information to agents of governments, corporations, or apps.

### Sybil battleground

Aura hosts the best motivated, best equipped, and most capable [sybil defenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack). Sybil defense moves from casual BrightID users to elite Aura players. Sybil attackers are forced to target highly skilled Aura players rather than BrightID users.

Aura players have â€œskin in the game."  Mistakes cost them [energy](../how-to-play/energy.md), which is the potential to verify people.

### Decentralized

Aura is resilient against fraud. If an [energy team](teams.md) becomes corrupted, other teams are waiting to take its place. The market for apps needing uniqueness verification determines which teams' answers in Aura are used as part of a [verification level](../how-to-play/verification-levels.md).

### Scalable

Apps seeking to expand into regions lacking verification can reward energy teams that cover those regions. On a local level, the need for uniqueness verification drives well-connected users to learn to become Aura players.\

[Energy](teams.md#rewarding-aura-players) provides an easy metric for [distributing monetary rewards to Aura players](teams.md#rewarding-aura-players).
