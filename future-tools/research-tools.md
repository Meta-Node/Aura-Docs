# ⚠️ Activity Alerts

[Trainers](../roles/trainers.md) are alerted to changes from the Players they train. This could include if a Player evaluates a large number of subjects in a short period, or their evaluation from other Trainers changes. Trainers should lower the confidence of their evaluation of suspicious Players or give them a negative evaluation to cut off their ability to verify subjects.
