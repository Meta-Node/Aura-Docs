# ⚠️ Activity Alerts

[Trainers](../advanced-roles/trainers.md) are alerted to changes in activity from the Players they train. This could include adding or updating a large number evaluations in a short period, or a change in their evaluation from other Trainers. Trainers should lower the confidence of their evaluation of suspicious Players or give them a negative evaluation; this will cut off their ability to verify subjects.
