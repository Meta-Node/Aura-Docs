# üîê Using Roles

## Unlocking Roles

The first step to unlock a role is to click the gear icon at the top of the app.

Click on "Role Management" to open the following screen.

Here you can see if you meet the requirements for an advanced role, and if so, you can choose to show it. It will then become visible throughout the app. Your score and level will be zero for an advanced role until you receive evaluations from a Manager. You can temporarily hide a role from the Role Management screen if you don't want to see it in the app.

The top bar of the home screen will show icons for all your visible roles.

Clicking a role icon will switch the view to show your score and level for that role. The "Evaluate" tab will show a list of people you can evaluate when acting in that role. The "Level Up" tab will show evaluations you've received and what you need to do to reach the next level in that role.

When viewing someone's profile, you can click an icon to view their activity and evaluations for any role they have (Subject, Player, Trainer, or Manager) and to evaluate them for that role (if you have the proper role unlocked).
