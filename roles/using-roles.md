## Unlocking Roles

The first step to unlock a role is to click the gear icon on the home screen.

Here you can see if you meet the requirements for an advanced role and if so, you can opt-in to show it. It will then become visible throughout the app. Your score and level will be 0 for an advanced role until you receive evaluations from a Manager. You can temporarily hide a role from here if you don't want to see it in the app.

The top bar of the home screen will show icons for all your visible roles.

Clicking a role icon will switch the view to show your score, level, activity, and evaluations for that role. The "Evaluate" tab will show a list of people you can evaluate when acting in that role.\

When viewing someone's profile, you can click an icon to view their activity and evaluations for any role they have (Subject, Player, Trainer, or Manager), and to evaluate them for that role (if you have the proper role unlocked).
