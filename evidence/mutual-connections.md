# 🔗 Mutual Connections

Players look at their mutual connections with the person they're evaluating. This is the default [filter](../advanced-features/filters-and-sorts.md) for the Connections tab of a Subject profile.

If expected “already known” connections are missing, this could be a sign of a [sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack), and a player should give the subject a low confidence or negative evaluation.
