### Impact

The impact bar chart shows the relative impacts of a person's evaluators on their score. It's often accompanied by the number of positive and negative evaluations they've received. Some evaluations might not have any impact if the evaluator is new or has a low score; no bar will be shown in this case.

The height of a bar indicates its impact.

### Confidence

The confidence of an evaluation is represented by the shade of a bar. Darker shades indicate higher confidence.

### Hover text

Hovering over a bar or picture will show the numerical representations of an evaluator's impact and confidence.

### Color

Your evaluation bar is purple. The person whose profile you're viewing has an orange evaluation bar.
