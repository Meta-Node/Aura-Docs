# 🔗 Expected Connections

Players look at the connections they have in common with the person they're evaluating and ensure that the ones they would expect to see are actually there. "Expected connect" is the default [filter](../advanced-features/filters.md) for the Connections tab of a Subject profile.

If expected “already known” connections are missing, this could be a sign of a [sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack), and a player should give the subject a low confidence or negative evaluation.
