# 🔗 Expected Connections

Players look at the connections they have in common with the person they're evaluating and ensure that the ones they would expect to see are actually there. [The "Smart Sort" default filter](../advanced-features/filters.md#smart-sort-default) for the Connections tab of a Subject Profile shows people that both you and the subject already know at the top of the results list.

Your connection level ("Already Known" 😎, for example) to a person is shown on the left side of their [connection card](participant-cards.md#connection-cards), while that person's connection level to the subject is shown on the right side of the card.

If expected “Already Known” connections are missing, this could be a sign of a [sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack), and you should give the subject a low confidence or negative evaluation.
