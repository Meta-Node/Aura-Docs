# ðŸ”½ Filters

Filters help you focus on the type of evidence you're interested in and organize your approach.

## Home Screen

{% content-ref url="../how-to-play/home-screen.md" %}
[home-screen.md](../how-to-play/home-screen.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The filters on the home screen are designed to help you find someone to evaluate or to update an existing evaluation.

### Recent connections (default)

The best way to find someone to evaluate is to connect or reconnect to them on BrightID. This will bring them to the top of the default sort on the Aura home page. From there you can go to their [profile](../how-to-play/subject-profile.md) and evaluate them. "Already Known" ðŸ˜Ž connections are shown above "Just Met" ðŸ‘‹ connections. Within those tiers, connections are sorted by most recent first.

### Recently evaluated

This allows you to review your recent evaluations and see how other people have evaluated the same subjects. If there is new evidence, you might want to change your evaluations.

## Connections Tab

### Smart sort (default)

This sort helps you find [connections that you and a subject both already know](../evidence/expected-connections.md).

{% content-ref url="../evidence/expected-connections.md" %}
[expected-connections.md](../evidence/expected-connections.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Smart sort is divided into three tiers:

1. Connections you and the subject both already know ("Already Known" ðŸ˜Ž connections).
2. Connections that have marked the subject as "Already Known" ðŸ˜Ž , but that you haven't marked as "Already Known" ðŸ˜Ž.
3. All of the subject's remaining connections.

Connections are sorted within each tier by most recent first.

### Their recovery

This shows who the subject chose as their recovery connections. This can help uncover suspicious behavior.

### Recovery

This shows who chose the subject as a recovery connection. This is the highest level of trust in BrightID. Users must choose their recovery connections carefully to maintain access to their account.

### Already Known+

This shows a subject's already known and recovery connections, sorted by most recent first.

## Evaluations Tab

### Expert evaluations (default)

Evaluations sorted by highest evaluator level and score first.

### Negative evaluations

Negative evaluations only, sorted by highest evaluator level and score first.

### Recent evaluations, level 1+ or 2+

Evaluations filtered by evaluator level, sorted by most recent first.

## Activity Tab

The Activity tab has views to show a participant's activity in the player, trainer or manager roles.

{% content-ref url="../evidence/activity.md" %}
[activity.md](../evidence/activity.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* Recent evaluations (default)
* Negative evaluations
* Confidence - Sorted by the most confident evaluations first

## Custom View

On each result list, you can set your own custom sort and filters by selecting "Custom view."
