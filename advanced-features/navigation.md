### Search within results

Profiles let you search within results in the Connections, Activity, and Evaluations tabs.

As you work in Aura, you might move between different profiles to find people to evaluate. Breadcrumbs help you see your history and visit previous profiles. Breadcrumbs also remember the views you selected on previous profiles.

### Closing the breadcrumb menu

When the breadcrumb menu is open, the icon turns into an "x." Clicking it closes the menu. Existing breadcrumbs will still be saved.
