The magnifying glass icon on the top right of every page will open a dialog where you can search for any of your BrightID connections by name or BrightID.

### Search within results

Profile pages let you search within results in the connections, activity, and evaluation tabs.

The blue icon in the upper left of most pages opens the breadcrumb menu.

As you work in Aura, you might move between lists of results to find people to evaluate. Breadcrumbs help you see your history and visit previous profile pages. Breadcrumbs also remember the filters you selected on previous pages.

### Closing the breadcrumb menu

When the breadcrumb menu is open, the icon turns into a white x on a blue background. Clicking it closes the menu. Existing breadcrumbs will still be saved.
